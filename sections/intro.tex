With a strong foundation in machine learning and 3D digital human modeling. My work on DeepGesture and the GENEA Leaderboard showcases end-to-end expertise, from training transformer and diffusion models on SMPL/BEAT 2 datasets to deploying production-grade evaluation systems and interactive 3D applications using Python, C++, and WebGL. I bring a combination of research depth and engineering execution to advance \textbf{Meshcapade}â€™s mission.
% and I am well-suite for the ML Engineer for 3D Digital Humans role at \textbf{Meshcapade}.
